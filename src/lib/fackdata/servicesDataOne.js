                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    <strong>Parent training:</strong> Structured guidance for parents to respond more effectively to their child’s behaviours using praise, clear rules and consistent consequences. This helps manage impulsive actions, tantrums and defiance, and supports a more positive home environment.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    <strong>Skill-building:</strong> Focus on executive functions such as organisation, planning and time management. Children learn to use tools like checklists, visual schedules and planners to stay on task and manage daily responsibilities more independently.

                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    CBT is an evidence-based approach that helps children understand how their thoughts, feelings and behaviours interact with ADHD symptoms. It teaches practical techniques for managing distractions, procrastination and emotional regulation.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    Sessions typically involve identifying specific challenges, setting realistic goals and developing coping strategies that children can carry forward as they grow. CBT is often most effective when combined with other therapies or medication as part of a comprehensive plan.

                    In addition to therapy, children with ADHD often benefit from a multi-faceted support system that may include educational accommodations, structured routines at home, lifestyle changes and close collaboration with teachers and healthcare providers.

                Some children exhibit challenging behaviors beyond their age norm, possibly due to temporary stressors or enduring disorders. Common disruptive disorders include ODD, CD, and ADHD. Boys are more prone to behavioral disorders.

                <li><strong>Temperament:</strong> Aggressive or difficult temperaments may lead to disorders.</li>
                <li><strong>Family life:</strong> Dysfunctional family environments increase the risk.</li>

        <p>Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of disorders that affect a person's ability to move and maintain balance and posture.<br />
        CP is the most common motor disability in childhood.<br />
        Cerebral means having to do with the brain. Palsy means weakness or problems with using the muscles. CP is caused by abnormal brain development or damage to the developing brain that affects a person's ability to control his or her muscles.<br />
        The symptoms of CP vary from person to person. A person with severe CP might need to use special equipment to be able to walk, or might not be able to walk at all and might need lifelong care.<br />
        A person with mild CP, on the other hand, might walk a little awkwardly, but might not need any special help. CP does not get worse over time, though the exact symptoms can change over a person's lifetime.</p>

            <p><strong>Types of Cerebral Palsy</strong></p>
            <p>Doctors classify CP according to the main type of movement disorder involved. Depending on which areas of the brain are affected, one or more of the following movement disorders can occur:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc space-y-4 pl-7 marker:text-pink-500 text-gray-700">
                <li>Stiff muscles (spasticity)</li>

    <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-full text-gray-700 mb-12">
        <p><strong><u>Spastic Cerebral Palsy</u></strong></p>
        <p>The most common type of CP is spastic CP. Spastic CP affects about 80% of people with CP.</p>
        <p>People with spastic CP have increased muscle tone. This means their muscles are stiff and, as a result, their movements can be awkward. Spastic CP usually is described by what parts of the body are affected:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc space-y-4 pl-7 marker:text-pink-500 text-gray-700">
            <li>Spastic diplegia/diparesis―In this type of CP, muscle stiffness is mainly in the legs, with the arms less affected or not affected at all. People with spastic diplegia might have difficulty walking because tight hip and leg muscles cause their legs to pull together, turn inward, and cross at the knees (also known as scissoring.</li>
            <li>Spastic hemiplegia/hemiparesis―This type of CP affects only one side of a person's body; usually the arm is more affected than the leg.</li>
            <li>Spastic quadriplegia/quadriparesis―Spastic quadriplegia is the most severe form of spastic CP and affects all four limbs, the trunk, and the face. People with spastic quadriparesis usually cannot walk and often have other developmental disabilities such as intellectual disability; seizures; or problems with vision, hearing, or speech.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><u><strong>Dyskinetic Cerebral Palsy</strong></u></p>
        <p>People with dyskinetic CP have problems controlling the movement of their hands, arms, feet, and legs, making it difficult to sit and walk. The movements are uncontrollable and can be slow and writhing or rapid and jerky. Sometimes the face and tongue are affected and the person has a hard time sucking, swallowing, and talking. A person with dyskinetic CP has muscle tone that can change (varying from too tight to too loose) not only from day to day, but even during a single day.</p>

        <p><strong><u>Ataxic Cerebral Palsy</u></strong></p>
        <p>People with ataxic CP have problems with balance and coordination. They might be unsteady when they walk. They might have a hard time with quick movements or movements that need a lot of control, like writing. They might have a hard time controlling their hands or arms when they reach for something.</p>

        <p><strong>Mixed Cerebral Palsy</strong></p>
        <p>Some people have symptoms of more than one type of CP. The most common type of mixed CP is spastic-dyskinetic CP.</p>

        <p><strong>Screening and Diagnosis</strong></p>
        <p>Diagnosing CP at an early age is important to the well-being of children and their families. Diagnosing CP can take several steps:</p>
        <ul class="list-none space-y-4">
            <li>
                <strong>Developmental Monitoring</strong>
                <p class="ml-6">Developmental monitoring means tracking a child's growth and development over time. If any concerns about the child's development are raised during monitoring, then a developmental screening test should be given as soon as possible.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Developmental Screening</strong>
                <p class="ml-6">During developmental screening a short test is given to see if the child has specific developmental delays, such as motor or movement delays. If the results of the screening test are cause for concern, then the doctor will make referrals for developmental and medical evaluations.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Developmental and Medical Evaluations</strong>
                <p class="ml-6">The goal of a developmental evaluation is to diagnose the specific type of disorder that affects a child.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Treatments and Intervention Services</strong></p>
        <p>There is no cure for CP, but treatment can improve the lives of those who have the condition. It is important to begin a treatment program as early as possible.</p>

                Learning disabilities are not a problem with intelligence or motivation. Children with learning disabilities aren’t lazy or dumb; their brains are simply wired differently. This difference affects how they receive and process information, leading to trouble with learning new skills and putting them to use. The most common types of learning disabilities involve problems with reading, writing, math, reasoning, listening, and speaking.

                Paying attention to normal developmental milestones is very important. Early detection of developmental differences may be an early signal of a learning disability, and problems that are spotted early can be easier to correct. If you think there is a problem, it doesn’t hurt to get an evaluation.

                Intellectual disability refers to limitations in a person's ability to learn and function in daily life. Children with this disability may learn and develop more slowly than their peers. It can be caused by injury, disease, or brain issues that occur before the age of 18.
