                Some children exhibit challenging behaviors beyond their age norm, possibly due to temporary stressors or enduring disorders. Common disruptive disorders include oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), conduct disorder (CD), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Boys are more prone to behavioral disorders. Treatment options include parent management training, cognitive behavior therapy, medication, and addressing associated problems.

                <li><strong>Gender:</strong> Boys are more likely than girls to have behavioral disorders.</li>
                <li><strong>Gestation and birth:</strong> Difficult pregnancies, premature birth, and low birth weight may contribute to later behavioral problems.</li>
                <li><strong>Temperament:</strong> Children who are difficult, temperamental, or aggressive early on are more likely to develop behavioral disorders.</li>
                <li><strong>Family life:</strong> Dysfunctional families, with issues like domestic violence, poverty, poor parenting, or substance abuse, increase a child's risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Learning difficulties:</strong> Reading and writing problems are often linked to behavior issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Intellectual disabilities:</strong> Children with intellectual disabilities are twice as likely to have behavioral disorders.</li>
                <li><strong>Brain development:</strong> Studies show less active attention-controlling brain areas in children with ADHD.</li>

            <p>
                Disruptive behavioral disorders are complex. Diagnosis is made by a specialist and may involve interviews and behavior checklists. It is based on criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Untreated disorders can lead to dysfunctional adulthood, so earlier intervention generally yields better outcomes.

                Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of disorders affecting movement, balance, and posture. It's the most common motor disability in childhood, caused by abnormal brain development or damage. While CP doesn't worsen over time, its symptoms can change.

            <p>
                Early diagnosis is crucial. Signs vary by age and can include developmental delays like head lagging, stiffness, or difficulty with motor skills. Diagnosis involves developmental monitoring, screening, and medical evaluations.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Treatment and Intervention</h3>
            <p>
                There is no cure for CP, but early treatment and intervention services can significantly improve the lives of those affected.
