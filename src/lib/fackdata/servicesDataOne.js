                Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of disorders affecting movement, balance, and posture. It's the most common motor disability in childhood, caused by abnormal brain development or damage. While CP doesn't worsen over time, its symptoms can change.

            <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
                <li><strong>Spastic CP:</strong> The most common type (80%), causing stiff muscles and awkward movements. It can be further described by the parts of the body affected (diplegia, hemiplegia, or quadriplegia).</li>
                <li><strong>Dyskinetic CP:</strong> Difficulty controlling the movement of hands, arms, feet, and legs, making it difficult to sit and walk.</li>
                <li><strong>Ataxic CP:</strong> Problems with balance and coordination, leading to unsteadiness.</li>
                <li><strong>Mixed CP:</strong> A combination of symptoms from different types, most commonly spastic-dyskinetic CP.</li>

        <ul class="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
            <li><strong>In a baby younger than 6 months:</strong> Head lagging, feeling stiff or floppy, overextending back/neck, or stiffening and crossing legs.</li>
            <li><strong>In a baby older than 6 months:</strong> Not rolling over, unable to bring hands together or to the mouth, reaching with only one hand.</li>
            <li><strong>In a baby older than 10 months:</strong> Lopsided crawling or not crawling on all fours.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Diagnosis involves developmental monitoring, screening tests, and medical evaluations.</p>

            Adolescence is a critical and formative period for developing the social and emotional habits essential for lifelong mental well-being. Physical, emotional, and social changes, along with exposure to adversity, can make teens vulnerable to mental health challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            Failure to address these issues can lead to impaired health in adulthood. Our mental health promotion and prevention services aim to strengthen emotion regulation, offer alternatives to risky behaviors, build resilience, and foster supportive social environments for adolescents.

            Supportive environments in the family, school, and community are vital for helping teens navigate this important stage of life.
