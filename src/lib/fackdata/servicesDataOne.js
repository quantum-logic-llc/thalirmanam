        content: `<h2>Behavioural Concerns in Children</h2>
<p>Some children have extremely difficult and challenging behaviours that are outside the norm for their age. These problems can result from temporary stressors in the child's life, or they might represent more enduring disorders. The most common disruptive behaviour disorders include oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), conduct disorder (CD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Boys are more likely than girls to suffer from behavioural disorders. Treatment options include parent management training, cognitive behaviour therapy, medication and treatment for associated problems.</p>

<h3>Risk Factors</h3>

<h4>Gender</h4>
<p>Boys are much more likely than girls to suffer from behavioural disorders. It is unclear if the cause is genetic or linked to socialisation experiences.</p>

<h4>Gestation and birth</h4>
<p>Difficult pregnancies, premature birth and low birth weight may contribute in some cases to the child's problem behaviour later in life.</p>

<h4>Temperament</h4>
<p>Children who are difficult to manage, temperamental or aggressive from an early age are more likely to develop behavioural disorders later in life.</p>

<h4>Family life</h4>
<p>Behavioural disorders are more likely in dysfunctional families. For example, a child is at increased risk in families where domestic violence, poverty, poor parenting skills or substance abuse are a problem.</p>

<h4>Learning difficulties</h4>
<p>Problems with reading and writing are often associated with behaviour problems.</p>

<h4>Intellectual disabilities</h4>
<p>Children with intellectual disabilities are twice as likely to have behavioural disorders.</p>

<h4>Brain development</h4>
<p>Studies have shown that areas of the brain that control attention appear to be less active in children with ADHD.</p>

<h3>Diagnosis of children's behavioural disorders</h3>
<p>Disruptive behavioural disorders are complicated and may include many different factors working in combination. For example, a child who exhibits the delinquent behaviours of CD may also have ADHD, Anxiety, depression and a difficult home life.</p>

<p><strong>Diagnosis methods may include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Diagnosis by a specialist service, which may include a paediatrician, psychologist or child psychiatrist</li>
<li>In-depth interviews with the parents, child and teachers</li>
<li>Behaviour checklists or standardised questionnaires.</li>
</ul>

<p>A diagnosis is made if the child's behaviour meets the criteria for disruptive behaviour disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders from the American Psychiatric Association.</p>

<p>It is important to rule out acute stressors that might be disrupting the child's behaviour. For example, a sick parent or victimising by other children might be responsible for sudden changes in a child's typical behaviour and these factors have to be considered initially.</p>

<h3>Treatment of behavioural disorders in children</h3>
<p>Untreated children with behavioural disorders may grow up to be dysfunctional adults. Generally, the earlier the intervention, the better the outcome is likely to be.</p>`

        content: `<h2>Cerebral Palsy</h2>
<p>Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of disorders that affect a person's ability to move and maintain balance and posture. CP is the most common motor disability in childhood, caused by abnormal brain development or damage affecting muscle control.</p>

<h3>Key Points</h3>
<ul>
<li>Symptoms vary significantly by individual severity</li>
<li>Does not worsen over time, though symptoms may change</li>
<li>No cure exists, but early treatment improves outcomes</li>
</ul>

<h3>Types of Cerebral Palsy</h3>

<h4>Spastic CP (80% of cases)</h4>
<p>Characterized by increased muscle tone and stiff movements. Subtypes include diplegia (legs primarily), hemiplegia (one body side), and quadriplegia (all four limbs, most severe).</p>

<h4>Dyskinetic CP</h4>
<p>Involves uncontrollable movements of extremities, with variable muscle tone fluctuating daily.</p>

<h4>Ataxic CP</h4>
<p>Affects balance and coordination, causing unsteady gait and difficulty with controlled movements.</p>

<h4>Mixed CP</h4>
<p>Combines symptoms from multiple types.</p>

<h3>Early Warning Signs</h3>

<h4>In infants under 6 months</h4>
<p>Head lag, stiffness, or floppiness.</p>

<h4>In older babies</h4>
<p>Inability to roll, hand coordination difficulties, or one-sided reaching.</p>

<h4>Beyond 10 months</h4>
<p>Lopsided crawling or scooting rather than typical crawling patterns.</p>

<h3>Diagnosis Process</h3>
<p>Involves developmental monitoring, screening tests, and comprehensive evaluations to identify specific disorder types.</p>`

<p>Developmental delays can affect a child's physical, cognitive, communication, social, emotional, or behavioural skills. Often, developmental delays affect more than one area of a child's development.</p>

<p>When delays span multiple developmental areas, it's termed global developmental delay. While some delays have identifiable causes, many remain unexplained.</p>

<h3>Cognitive Delays</h3>
<p>Affect intellectual functioning and learning. Can result from brain injuries, infections like meningitis, shaken baby syndrome, seizure disorders, or chromosomal conditions such as Down syndrome.</p>

<h3>Motor Delays</h3>
<p>Interfere with coordination of large and small muscles. Gross motor delays affect rolling, crawling, and walking; fine motor delays impact grasping objects and tasks like tying shoes. Caused by genetic conditions, muscular disorders, cerebral palsy, or structural problems.</p>

<h3>Social, Emotional, and Behavioural Delays</h3>
<p>Children may struggle understanding social cues, initiating communication, or managing frustration. They often take longer to calm down and may benefit from environmental modifications.</p>

<h3>Speech Delays</h3>
<p>Include receptive disorders (difficulty understanding words), expressive disorders (limited vocabulary/complex sentences), and speech production disorders affecting mouth muscle control.</p>`

<h3>Learning Disabilities and Disorders</h3>

<p><strong>Does your child struggle with school?</strong></p>
<p>Do they dread reading out loud, writing an essay, or tackling math? Here's how to recognize the signs of different types of learning disorders.</p>

<p>Learning disabilities or learning disorders are umbrella terms for a wide variety of learning problems.</p>

<p>A learning disability is not a problem with intelligence or motivation and kids with learning disabilities aren't lazy or dumb.</p>

<p>In fact, most are just as smart as everyone else. Their brains are simply wired differentlyâ€”and this difference affects how they receive and process information.</p>

<p>Simply put, children and adults with learning disabilities see, hear, and understand things differently. This can lead to trouble with learning new information and skills, and putting them to use. The most common types of learning disabilities involve problems with reading, writing, math, reasoning, listening, and speaking.</p>

<p>While every kid has trouble with homework from time to time, if a certain area of learning is consistently problematic, it might indicate a learning disorder.</p>

<h3>Red Flags for Learning Disabilities and Disorders</h3>
<ul>
<li>Problems pronouncing words.</li>
<li>Trouble finding the right word.</li>
<li>Difficulty rhyming.</li>
<li>Trouble learning the alphabet, numbers, colours, shapes, or days of the week.</li>
<li>Difficulty following directions or learning routines.</li>
<li>Difficulty controlling crayons, pencils, and scissors, or colouring within the lines.</li>
<li>Trouble with buttons, zippers, snaps, or learning to tie shoes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Signs and symptoms of learning disabilities: Ages 5-9</h3>
<ul>
<li>Trouble learning the connection between letters and sounds.</li>
<li>Unable to blend sounds to make words.</li>
<li>Confuses basic words when reading.</li>
<li>Slow to learn new skills.</li>
<li>Consistently misspells words and makes frequent errors.</li>
<li>Trouble learning basic math concepts.</li>
<li>Difficulty telling time and remembering sequences.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Signs and Symptoms of learning disabilities: Ages 10-13</h3>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty with reading comprehension or math skills.</li>
<li>Trouble with open-ended test questions and word problems.</li>
<li>Dislikes reading and writing; avoids reading aloud.</li>
<li>Poor handwriting.</li>
<li>Poor organizational skills (bedroom, homework, and desk are messy and disorganized).</li>
<li>Trouble following classroom discussions and expressing thoughts aloud.</li>
<li>Spells the same word differently in a single document.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Paying attention to developmental milestones can help you identify learning disorders</h3>
<p>Paying attention to normal developmental milestones for toddlers and preschoolers is very important. Early detection of developmental differences may be an early signal of a learning disability and problems that are spotted early can be easier to correct.</p>

<p>A developmental lag might not be considered a symptom of a learning disability until your child is older, but if you recognize it when your child is young, you can intervene early.</p>

<p>You know your child better than anyone else does, so if you think there is a problem, it doesn't hurt to get an evaluation. You can also ask your pediatrician for a developmental milestones chart.</p>`

        content: `<h2>What is intellectual disability?</h2>
<p>Intellectual disability is a term used when there are limits to a person's ability to learn at an expected level and function in daily life.</p>

<p>Children with intellectual disability might struggle with communication, self-care, learning, and development. The condition can result from various causes occurring before, during, or after birth.</p>

<h3>Common Causes</h3>
<p>Down syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome, fragile X syndrome, genetic conditions, birth defects, infections, serious head injury, and stroke.</p>

<h2>What are some of the signs of intellectual disability?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Delayed motor milestones (sitting, crawling, walking)</li>
<li>Speech delays or difficulties</li>
<li>Memory challenges</li>
<li>Difficulty understanding social rules</li>
<li>Trouble recognizing consequences of actions</li>
<li>Problem-solving difficulties</li>
</ul>

<p>The School Readiness is a unique individualised training to assist children with unique learning and behavioural challenges to transition into schooling.</p>

<p>It is for children who need extra support and help to develop their group readiness skills, engage in early academics, enhance their social skills, improve their fine motor skills, and further develop their language and communication skills. Early intervention can have significant impact on child's development by learning new skills and be prepared to face the challenges, prevent the occurrence of problems or to tackle them head on before they get worse.</p>

<h3>Some of the characteristics that are expected in a child to show school readiness are as follows:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Independent in toileting and indicate the needs</li>
<li>Able to dress themselves with minimal assistance</li>
<li>Understands expected levels of behaviour</li>
<li>Confidence and self-esteem</li>
<li>Can wait for turns and share</li>
<li>Can sit still for a short period during the class and not disturb others</li>
<li>Can separate from parents/carers</li>
<li>Communication and language skills needed to communicate needs and listen to others</li>

<p>Adolescence is a crucial period for developing social and emotional habits important for mental well-being. These include adopting healthy sleep patterns; exercising regularly; developing coping, problem-solving, and interpersonal skills; and learning to manage emotions. Protective and supportive environments in the family, at school and in the wider community are important.</p>

<p>One in six people are aged 10â€“19 years. Adolescence is a unique and formative time. Physical, emotional and social changes, including exposure to poverty, abuse, or violence, can make adolescents vulnerable to mental health problems.</p>

<p>Protecting adolescents from adversity, promoting socio-emotional learning and psychological well-being, and ensuring access to mental health care are critical for their health and well-being during adolescence and adulthood.</p>

<p>The consequences of failing to address adolescent mental health conditions extend to adulthood, impairing both physical and mental health and limiting opportunities to lead fulfilling lives as adults.</p>

<p>Behavioural problems, eating disorders, suicidal tendencies and risk taking behaviours are very common among adolescents and Mental health promotion and prevention interventions aim to strengthen an individual's capacity to regulate emotions, enhance alternatives to risk-taking behaviours, build resilience for managing difficult situations and adversity, and promote supportive social environments and social networks.</p>`
