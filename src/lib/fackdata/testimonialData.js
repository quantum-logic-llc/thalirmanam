She has a very compassionate and wonderful approach. She listened to our problems and very patiently explained the treatment plan. She made us feel confident and informed about our son's diagnosis.She guided us patiently and carefully outlined our treatment options. Under her care and guidance our son is showing wonderful improvement. She reaches out to us to know about therapy review and gives a lot of helpful suggestions to improve him.There are monthly reviews about the goals achieved and she discusses the same with the therapists as well. We are genuinely happy that we met her at the crucial time and steered us in the right direction. Dr Naveena has made a positive difference in our lives",
